# STM32F446RE_Peripheral_Drivers

These drivers serve as a Hardware Abstraction Layer for the input and output peripherals for an STM32F446RE microcontroller.

The drivers are written based off information given from the Udemy Course: Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development by Fastbit Brain Academy and the microcontroller reference manual.

There will be drivers for GPIO and serial communications such as I2C, SPI, and USART.


Current Progress: 

GPIO Driver: Complete

SPI Driver: In Progress

I2C Driver: To-Do

USART Driver: To-Do
