# STM32F446RE_Peripheral_Drivers

These drivers serve as a Hardware Abstraction Layer for the input and output peripherals for an STM32F446RE microcontroller.

The drivers are written based off information given from the Udemy Course: Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development by Fastbit Brain Academy.

There will be drivers for GPIO and serial communications such as I2C, SPI, and UART.
